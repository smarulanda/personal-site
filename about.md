![About Me]({{ site.s3 }}/images/about.jpg){:class="th"}

I'm Sebastian, a full stack web developer and designer living in the bustling east side of Atlanta.

I began my undergraduate career at Georgia Tech as an Aerospace Engineering major, but I ended up falling in love with the problem solving aspect of programming. You could write a script, hit run, and it either worked or it didn't. There was an immediacy to it that I wasn't getting with my theoretical engineering problems. So I switched majors.

I've been working here in Atlanta since graduating from Tech. My full time job is as an Applications Engineer for a fantastic company called [Peach New Media](http://peachnewmedia.com), but I also spend a lot of my free time freelancing or working on [side projects](/projects).

Outside of web development I've got an eclectic mix of hobbies. Music has always been a huge passion. I love collecting and learning new instruments. Other relaxing pastimes include painting and knitting (if you're on my nice list these holidays, you're getting a homemade hat). Physical health is also an important part of my life. I try to get some activity in every day, whether it's playing tennis, cycling, or weight lifting. 

If you want to drop me a line (and you aren't a recruiter), I'd love to help get your project off the ground! Contact me [here](/contact).
