![About Me]({{ site.s3 }}/images/about.jpg){:class="th"}

I'm Sebastian, a full stack web developer and designer living in Atlanta.

I've been working in town since graduating from Georgia Tech. My full time job is as an Applications Engineer for a fantastic company called [Peach New Media](http://peachnewmedia.com), but I also spend a lot of my free time freelancing or working on side projects.

Outside of web development I've got an eclectic mix of hobbies. Music has always been a huge passion. I love collecting and learning new instruments. Other pastimes include painting, woodworking, reading, and knitting. Physical health is also an important part of my life. I try to get some activity in every day, whether it's playing tennis, cycling, or weight lifting. 

If you want to drop me a line (and you aren't a recruiter), I'd love to help get your project off the ground! Contact me [here](/contact).
